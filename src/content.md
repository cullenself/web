## Projects
### Satellite Visibility Simulation
Working with a team of undergraduate researchers under Dr. Brandon Jones, I began the development of a new type of numerical integrator. The entire project is geared towards simulating what a telescope on the ground would see if two satellites collide and breakup - this requires work in many different fields. Our team studied shader models for computer visualization, the propagation of light, telescope optics, and the physics of collisions. My work specifically was to tackle the forward propagation of a system state; that is, given an initial set of parameters and a model for how the system evolves, what will it look like in the future? I implemented a novel multirate additive Runge-Kutta system to account for both the fast and slow moving dynamics of the system.

### Horizon
Since GNSS satellites orbit over most of the sky, keeping a log of where satellites are seen by a stationary receiver reveals distinct features on the horizon. I processed through a month's worth of data and plotted the visible satellites to reveal a panoramic of the paths satellites take as they fly overhead. More information can be found [here](http://github.com/cullenself/horizon).

### UAV Avionics
As part of a team tasked with designing and building a small quadcopter, I developed and configured all flight control software. This involved fabricating a test stand, and implementing a quality control system to experimentally verify stability. Ultimately, I was responsible for making sure the quadcopter flew.

### GNSS Reference Network 
I've recently started work with Dr. Todd Humphreys in the UT Radionavigation Lab designing and building a network of GNSS reference stations for use around the city of Austin.

### Others
I have a few other projects up on my GitHub [page](http://github.com/cullenself), including practice work in a few languages and this website.
